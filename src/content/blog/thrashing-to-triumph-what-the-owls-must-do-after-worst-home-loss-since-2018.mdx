# Wow. Well then.
Last night was the worst loss in the Elly since January 4th, 2018, when UAB beat the squad 75-44 to start the conference play. Memphis had their way from the opening tip, going on a 9-0 run and forcing a quick timeout by Coach John Jakus. They did not look back from there.

People left the arena at halftime for the first time in years. The athletic department’s valiant efforts to bring a crowd could not convince the disgruntled fans to stay. 

 3 after 3, poster after poster, one forced turnover after the other, the Tigers simply outclassed the Owls. The Owls tried to claw their way back in, but shooting 30% from the field and 16% from the 3 is a recipe for failure.
## The Solution
Now, this is where things get interesting. John Jakus is in a precarious situation. Let’s face it, every team gets their ass kicked once in a while. Some teams get their teeth smashed in and let the next team break their nose. That is when it gets dicey.
John Jakus and the Owls cannot let this loss derail conference play. Yesterday is gone. It is an unfortunate footnote in the arena’s history. No matter what, the Beach Boys can’t undo that thrashing. Their will to win was stolen from them, as the Commercial Appeal stated. However, they must regain it. Great teams get their teeth smashed in and turn into prime Jaromir Jagr. They fight back and make sure they stay together. Boca Raton’s Cinderellas must remember their coach’s motto: relationships over everything. The best relationships have been tested to their limit and come back even stronger.
The coaching staff must sit the guys down and tell them to stand firm. Playing the blame game will only hurt in the long run. They need to remember how they meshed and the great games they played together. Indiana State, Liberty, FIU. Quality wins are won by individuals choosing to be a group of teammates.
Then, use the Jumbotron to play Sylvester Stallone’s iconic film.
Rocky Balboa’s iconic speech should be imprinted in the roster’s head. 
>But it ain’t about how hard you hit; it’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done*!”*

You can’t win every game, but you can do your damnedest to prevent multiple blowouts.

A good coach knows how to prevent a snowball of losses. 

 Is Coach Jakus a good coach? Ask NBA Champion head coach Joe Mazzulla—or national champion head coach Scott Drew. 

 They might know more than I do.
