# This is Culturally Inappropriate
Two brothers turned back the clock this summer. Gene and Terrence Thornton, better known as Malice and Pusha T, had an album rollout headed by publicist turned label president.
In July, after months of teasing the media, the brothers released their first album together in over a decade. "Let God Sort Em Out" is a walking contradiction that is both a euology and a middle finger to inauthenticity.
The Virgina Beach natives formed Clipse in 1994, with their debut studio album reaching #4 on the Billboard 200. Their next two albums both were cultural successes. Unfortunately, it did not last. In 2010, Clipse went their separate ways. 
Malice became No Malice and leaned into gospel music. Pusha T signed with Kanye West and became a star for West's G.O.O.D. Music label.
Years passed, and the Thornton's continued to shine in their spaces. Both were Grammy nominated artists with Pusha T entering the mainstream with his feud with Drake

## The Solution
Now, this is where things get interesting. John Jakus is in a precarious situation. Let’s face it, every team gets their ass kicked once in a while. Some teams get their teeth smashed in and let the next team break their nose. That is when it gets dicey.
John Jakus and the Owls cannot let this loss derail conference play. Yesterday is gone. It is an unfortunate footnote in the arena’s history. No matter what, the Beach Boys can’t undo that thrashing. Their will to win was stolen from them, as the Commercial Appeal stated. However, they must regain it. Great teams get their teeth smashed in and turn into prime Jaromir Jagr. They fight back and make sure they stay together. Boca Raton’s Cinderellas must remember their coach’s motto: relationships over everything. The best relationships have been tested to their limit and come back even stronger.
The coaching staff must sit the guys down and tell them to stand firm. Playing the blame game will only hurt in the long run. They need to remember how they meshed and the great games they played together. Indiana State, Liberty, FIU. Quality wins are won by individuals choosing to be a group of teammates.
Then, use the Jumbotron to play Sylvester Stallone’s iconic film.
Rocky Balboa’s iconic speech should be imprinted in the roster’s head. 
>But it ain’t about how hard you hit; it’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done*!”*

You can’t win every game, but you can do your damnedest to prevent multiple blowouts.

A good coach knows how to prevent a snowball of losses. 

 Is Coach Jakus a good coach? Ask NBA Champion head coach Joe Mazzulla—or national champion head coach Scott Drew. 

 They might know more than I do.
