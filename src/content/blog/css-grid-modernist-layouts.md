# Florida Atlantic men’s basketball, better known as the Beach Boys, changed the university in ways no one expected.


By now, everybody knows the story. 35 wins, Conference USA championship, and improbable win after improbable win until they fell in the final shot against the San Diego State Aztecs.

Dusty May and his roster will always be legends to the Florida Atlantic community and a testament to the magic of March Madness.

Reminiscing is fun, and I will always look at the Final Four as the event that changed my university 1.8 miles from the beach into a household name.


## It’s time to turn the page.

To put it into perspective, Nick Boyd’s university-altering layup was 18 months ago.

Nelly’s iconic interview, Vlad’s rimrocking dunks, and A-Mart’s 3-point celebrations are all exhibits of the past.

Even the players themselves have left.

Einstein had a quote that all sports fans should remember:

> “‘I’m more interested in the future than the past because the future is where I intend to live.” 

# Enter Coach John Jakus, a proven winner.


## "Relationships over Everything"

oach Jakus’s track record speaks for itself. Jakus was the associate head coach for the Baylor Bears basketball squad. He helped the roster capture a national championship and back-to-back conference titles during that time. Along with his winning tendencies, he also has helped develop 3 1st round NBA draft picks. Jeremy Sochan, Davion Mitchell, and now Keyonte George are all playing the highest level of basketball in the world.

Jakus does not just have success to prove his greatness; he has legends of the game vouching for him. His former coach, Gonzaga head coach Mark Few, emphasized his commitment to the game and his players. Gonzaga is the blueprint of what midmajor schools strive to be: the Bulldogs were a relatively small school until their basketball program’s success catapulted it into the national spotlight.

NBA champion coach Joe Mazzulla always praised Jakus not just for his basketball expertise but also for his appreciation for the humanity of his players. Jakus has a formula for winning: relationships over everything.

You can learn all the technical aspects of basketball and all the strategies, but if you cannot relate to the person holding the basketball, you will not be a good coach.

## The Fellas
According to fluentslang.com, “the term fella is a shortened version of “fellow person” and is commonly used to refer to a friend or any random person.”

Even though these athletes are all-conference players of the year or even scouted by NBA teams, at the core, they are people. Given Coach Jakus’ ideology that relationships are everything, the 2024-2025 class will be defined as such. 

It seems like the coaching staff listens to Pitbull because the roster contains more international players than the average D1 team.

 According to the NCAA, just over 85 percent of DI men’s basketball players have a listed hometown in one of the 50 U.S. states, plus Washington D.C., which means DI teams have an average of nearly 2.3 international players per school. (Wittry, 2022).

According to the Florida Atlantic’s roster, they have 7 international players. Jakus has assembled a roster with more than triple the amount of international players than the average university. International play has boomed recently, with the NBA dominated by foreigners (see Jokic, Giannis, Luka).

A few of Jakus’ recruits have played international hoop on the biggest stage.

 Both big men have played basketball for Lithuania. Matas Vokietaitis and Mantas Kocanas both represented their country in overseas tournaments. Considering their similarities; seeing how Jakus incorporates them into the roster will be very interesting.

Senegal native Amar Amkou played basketball for the  NBA’s African Academy. He impressed so much that he even won Rookie of the Year in his program.

Coach Jakus has ties overseas, which played a factor in recruiting these individuals.

Jakus has recruited talent that is based on his guard-heavy playstyle. Picking up the SWAC player of the year in Ken Evans Jr while adding all-conference players in Leland Walker and KyKy Tandy indicates that Jakus will promote a small ball-esque offense. 


## Asymmetrical Balance: The Mondrian Grid

Piet Mondrian's geometric compositions translate beautifully to CSS Grid. Here's how to create a Mondrian-inspired layout:

```css
.mondrian-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr 3fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: var(--grid-2);
  height: 100vh;
  background: #000;
}

.mondrian-grid > * {
  background: #fff;
}

.block-red {
  background: #dc2626;
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}

.block-blue {
  background: #005a8d;
  grid-column: 4;
  grid-row: 2 / 4;
}

.block-yellow {
  background: #e8a100;
  grid-column: 2 / 4;
  grid-row: 4;
}

/* White blocks fill the remaining space */
```

## Constructivist Typography with Grid

The Russian constructivists used diagonal lines and dynamic compositions. We can achieve similar effects with CSS Grid:

```css
.constructivist-poster {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(24, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(32, 1fr);
  height: 100vh;
  background: #f0e9d6;
}

.diagonal-text {
  grid-column: 3 / 20;
  grid-row: 5 / 15;
  transform: rotate(-45deg);
  font-size: clamp(3rem, 8vw, 8rem);
  font-weight: 900;
  color: #dc2626;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.vertical-accent {
  grid-column: 21 / 23;
  grid-row: 1 / -1;
  background: #2c2c2c;
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
  color: white;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  padding: var(--grid-4);
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  letter-spacing: 0.5em;
}
```

## Responsive Modernism

The Bauhaus designers couldn't have imagined responsive design, but their systematic approach adapts perfectly:

```css
.responsive-bauhaus {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: var(--grid-4);
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .responsive-bauhaus {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  }
  
  .feature-block {
    grid-column: span 6;
  }
  
  .sidebar-block {
    grid-column: span 3;
  }
  
  .full-width {
    grid-column: 1 / -1;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  .feature-block {
    grid-column: span 4;
  }
  
  .hero-block {
    grid-column: span 8;
    grid-row: span 2;
  }
}
```

## The Swiss Style Grid

The International Typographic Style (Swiss Style) refined Bauhaus principles into an even more systematic approach:

```css
.swiss-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 
    [full-start] minmax(var(--grid-4), 1fr) 
    [main-start] repeat(12, [col-start] 1fr [col-end]) 
    [main-end] minmax(var(--grid-4), 1fr) 
    [full-end];
  row-gap: var(--grid-unit);
}

.swiss-grid > * {
  grid-column: main;
}

.swiss-full-bleed {
  grid-column: full;
}

.swiss-narrow {
  grid-column: col-start 3 / col-end 10;
}

.swiss-sidebar {
  grid-column: col-start 1 / col-end 3;
}

.swiss-main {
  grid-column: col-start 4 / col-end 12;
}
```

## Creating Visual Rhythm with Grid

Modernist design is all about rhythm and repetition. Here's how to create a rhythmic layout:

```css
.rhythm-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: var(--grid-8);
  gap: var(--grid-2);
}

.rhythm-grid > :nth-child(4n+1) {
  grid-column: span 3;
  grid-row: span 4;
  background: #c13127;
}

.rhythm-grid > :nth-child(4n+2) {
  grid-column: span 2;
  grid-row: span 2;
  background: #005a8d;
}

.rhythm-grid > :nth-child(4n+3) {
  grid-column: span 3;
  grid-row: span 3;
  background: #e8a100;
}

.rhythm-grid > :nth-child(4n) {
  grid-column: span 5;
  grid-row: span 2;
  background: #2c2c2c;
}
```

## Advanced Techniques: Overlapping Grids

One powerful modernist technique is overlapping elements to create depth and visual interest:

```css
.overlap-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(8, 1fr);
}

.background-block {
  grid-column: 2 / 10;
  grid-row: 1 / 7;
  background: #f0e9d6;
  z-index: 1;
}

.foreground-block {
  grid-column: 6 / 13;
  grid-row: 3 / 9;
  background: #dc2626;
  z-index: 2;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  color: white;
  font-size: 2rem;
  font-weight: 900;
}

.accent-line {
  grid-column: 1 / 4;
  grid-row: 4 / 5;
  background: #2c2c2c;
  z-index: 3;
}
```

## Performance Considerations

While CSS Grid is powerful, modernist principles remind us to use only what we need:

```css
/* Avoid overly complex grids */
.simple-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; /* Simple ratios */
}

/* Use grid-template-areas for clarity */
.semantic-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "nav main aside"
    "footer footer footer";
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 200px;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
}

.header { grid-area: header; }
.nav { grid-area: nav; }
.main { grid-area: main; }
.aside { grid-area: aside; }
.footer { grid-area: footer; }
```

## Debugging Your Grid

Even the Bauhaus masters made mistakes. Here's a helpful debugging technique:

```css
.debug-grid {
  position: relative;
}

.debug-grid::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  background-image: 
    repeating-linear-gradient(
      0deg,
      rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1),
      rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1) 1px,
      transparent 1px,
      transparent var(--grid-unit)
    ),
    repeating-linear-gradient(
      90deg,
      rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1),
      rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1) 1px,
      transparent 1px,
      transparent var(--grid-unit)
    );
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 9999;
}
```

## The Philosophy in Practice

CSS Grid isn't just about creating layouts—it's about embodying design principles in code. When we use Grid effectively, we're not just arranging elements on a page. We're creating systems that:

- **Scale predictably**
- **Maintain proportions**
- **Create visual harmony**
- **Respect the user's needs**

The modernist designers believed that good design could improve society. While that might seem grandiose, there's truth in the idea that well-structured, accessible layouts make information more democratic and usable.

## Conclusion: The Grid as Liberation

The Bauhaus designers saw the grid not as a constraint but as liberation—a way to free design from arbitrary decisions and create truly functional beauty. CSS Grid gives us that same freedom today.

By understanding both the technical capabilities of CSS Grid and the design philosophy behind modernist layouts, we can create web experiences that are both beautiful and purposeful. The grid isn't just a tool; it's a way of thinking about space, proportion, and the relationship between elements.

As you build your next layout, remember: every `grid-template-column`, every `gap`, every `grid-area` is an opportunity to create order from chaos, to find beauty in mathematics, and to continue the modernist tradition in the digital age.
